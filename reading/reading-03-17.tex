\begin{problem}Let $f: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be a function that is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. 
  Suppose that $c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(c) > 0$. Show that there exists a $\delta > 0$ 
  such that the function $f$ is positive on the $\delta$-neighborhood of $c$.\\
  What if we only require continuity in $c$ as opposed to $\mathbb{R}$?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}Since $f$ is continuous there exists an $\epsilon>0$ for every 
  $\delta>0$ such that $f(x)$ is in the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $f(c)$. 
  Since $f(c)>0$, there are infinitely many +ve numbers in every neighborhood of it.
  And since \textbf{$f$ is continuous in all neighborhoods of $c$}, at least one such 
  neighborhoods contains $f>0$.\\

  A continuity on \textit{just} $c$ does not guarantee that there exists a neighborhood
  of $f(c)$ where $f>0$.
\end{solution}
